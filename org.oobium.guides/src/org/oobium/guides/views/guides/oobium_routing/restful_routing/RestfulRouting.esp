title RESTful Routing

p RESTful routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resourceful controller. 
	+w Instead of declaring separate routes for your index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy actions,
	+w a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code.

p Browsers request pages from Oobium by making a request for a URL using a specific HTTP method, such as GET, POST, PUT
	+w and DELETE. Each method is a request to perform an operation on the resource. A resource route maps a number of
	+w related request to the actions in a single controller, based on a common model.
