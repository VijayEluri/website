Javascript(String title = "Javascript")

title {title}

p Javascript is handled very much like CSS in an ESP file, and thus we'll go through it in the same manner.

p Javascript is written in ESP files using the "script" tag. Similar to the style tag, the script tag is overloaded
	+w to handle the many different things you may want to do. As in regular HTML, a script section can occur in the
	+w Head or Body elements. In ESP they are exactly the same so, for the sake of brevity, the examples below leave
	+w out the specifier.
