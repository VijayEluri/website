FileStructure(String title = "File Structure")

p Every ESP file has three distinct parts, though none of them actually need to be implemented. An empty file is
	+w valid, albeit not very useful. Any part that is missing becomes implied and will still compile fine - the only
	+w real constraint is that the parts that are implemented must be in the following order:

ul
	li Import Statements(s)
	li Constructor(s)
	li Everything else! (aka the markup)
