title Embedding Java in JavaScript

p Embedding Java code in Javascript is usually not as useful or necessary as it is in CSS because Javascript has its
	+w own ways of doing variables and equations. It still possible though, and works just the same as in a style
	+w element - by using the special ":=" assignment operator:

div.code <- code
	+= - String favcolor = <span class="javaText">"blue"</span>;\n
	+= \n
	+= <span class="espTag">script</span>\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span><span class="javaKeyword">function</span> setColor(el) {\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span>  el.color := favcolor; <span class="javaComment">// <- this is a Java assignment</span>\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span>}\n

p A more practical use for this, and the reason for its inclusion in ESP files, is for dealing with JSON data:

div.code <- code
	+= - String favcolor = <span class="javaText">"blue"</span>;\n
	+= \n
	+= <span class="espTag">script</span>\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span>var object = {\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span>  color := favcolor\n
	+= <span class="espTab">  </span>}\n
