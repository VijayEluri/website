p Observers are classes that hook into a model with methods that get called at certain moments of the model's lifecycle.
	+w Using these methods it is possible to write code that will run when ever an Oobium model is created, saved, updated,
	+w destroyed, or validated, but in a way that doesn't pollute the model with code that isn't directly related to
	+w its purpose.
