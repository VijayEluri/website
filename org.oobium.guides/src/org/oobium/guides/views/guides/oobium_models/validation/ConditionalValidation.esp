title Conditional Validation

p Sometimes it will make sense to validate an object only when a given predicate is satisfied. You can do that by using
	+w the "when" and "unless" options. You use the "when" option when you want to specify that the validation should
	+w happen. If you want to specify when the validation should not happen, then you use the "unless" option. Both of
	+w these options take a String that is the name of a method within the Model that should be called to evaluate the 
	+w condition and return a boolean result (if the method does not exist, then an error is logged and false is assumed).

p These options can point to a method that takes either no arguments, or a single argument that is of the same type
	+w as the field being validated. If multiple fields are being validated, then the method can be overloaded to handle
	+w multiple types of fields. When performing the validation, Oobium looks first for the single argument version of the
	+w method, so if both are provided then the no-argument version will never be used.

p The following code snippet shows the "when" option being used: if the Post is not being saved as published, then we
	+w don't care how long it is, but when it is being published we want to make sure it is at least 1000 characters.

div.code <- code.java
	+> @ModelDescription(
	+>   attrs = {
	+>     @Attribute(name="published", type=Date.class)
	+>   },
	+>   validations = {
	+>     @Validate(field="content", minLength=1000, when="hasPublished")
	+>   }
	+> )
	+> public Post extends PostModel {
	+> 
	+> }

p Of course, it would probably be even nicer if we could put a minimum requirement on the number of <i>words</i>, rather
	+w than just characters. Adding the "tokenizer" option in the following code helps us achieve this:

div.code <- code.java
	+> @Validate(field="content", minLength=1000, tokenizer="\\\\W+", when="isPublished")

p There are also two sub versions of the "unless" option that are available for you convenience: "unlessBlank" and 
	+w "unlessNull". As their names suggest, they indicate that the validation is to be run unless the value is either
	+w blank or null.
