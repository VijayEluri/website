title Model Object Lifecycle

p During the normal operation of an Oobium application, models may be created, updated, and destroyed. To help you
	+w control your application and its data, Oobium provides many hooks into this model life cycle.

p Sessions and caching help you manage your models in a multithreaded environment, validations allow you to ensure
	+w that only valid data is persisted to your data store, and observers provide a means to trigger logic before
	+w or after an alteration of a model's state.
