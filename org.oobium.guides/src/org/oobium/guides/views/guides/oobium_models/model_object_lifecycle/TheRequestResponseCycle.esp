TheRequestResponseCycle(String title = "The Request-Response Cycle")

p When handling requests in a standard request-response cycle, Oobium sets up and tears down the model persistors,
	+w and their sessions, automatically for you. It also does this in a single thread (each execution path through
	+w a controller happens in a single thread) so that you don't have to worry about concurrency issues.

p At the beginning of a request, models will be injected with an appropriate persistor, whose session will be opened.
	+w Once the request has been handled, the Oobium framework will close the persistors' sessions and release them. This
	+w is all done automatically so that all you have to worry about is creating and using your models in a way that
	+w flows properly with your application logic.
