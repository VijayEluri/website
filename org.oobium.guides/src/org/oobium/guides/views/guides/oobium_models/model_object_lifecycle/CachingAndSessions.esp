title Caching and Sessions

p Oobium provides basic caching support in the context of sessions. Between the time a session is created, by calling
	+w the openSession(String) method of the persistor, and it is terminated, by calling the corresponding closeSession()
	+w method on the same persistor, each unique model requested should only be retrieved from the actual data source
	+w only once. Repeat calls to the same model during this time should instead return the object from the persistor's
	+w cache. Any save or update should, of course, invalidate the cache and the next retrieval will, in fact, go back
	+w to the data source.
