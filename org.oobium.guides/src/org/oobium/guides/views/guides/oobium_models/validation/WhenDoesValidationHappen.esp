title When does Validation Happen?

p Validation can occur before any operation that could change the model's state is executed. These operations are:
ul
	li create
	li destroy
	li save
	li update

p If a validation fails, indicating that the state of the model is not valid, then the operation is stopped and no
	+w changes are persisted.

p By default, all validations run on either create or update (which automatically get called on a save), but this
	+w can be changed by using the "on" property of the @Validate annotation:

div.code <- code.java
	+= @Validate(field="name", isNotNull=true, on=Validate.<span class="javaStaticField">UPDATE</span>)

p The on method takes an int, and the acceptable ones are defined in the Validate class itself - using static imports
	+w makes this code look nicer.

p If you want to specify that a validation run on multiple operations, they can be bitwise-OR'ed:

div.code <- code.java
	+= @Validate(field="name", isNotNull=true,
	+w on=<span class="javaStaticField">UPDATE</span> | <span class="javaStaticField">DESTROY</span>)
