Workers(String title = "Workers")

p There are plenty of times that it would be great to run things in a separate thread, or background task. Because this
	+w is so common (and rightfully so), Oobium has Worker classes that you can use.

p Essentially, Workers are just like threads (Executors, actually) except that they perform two extra helpful tidbits:
ol
	li Setup and Teardown your model persistors and their sessions (the same lifecycle as when handling a request)
	li Execute in limited numbers so your application doesn't crash when you accidentally submit 100,000 of them (oops)
